# JAMG - Movie Evaluation Platform

![JAMG Preview](https://github.com/jorge210488/jamg/blob/main/front/imagenes/jamg.png?raw=true)

## Description

**JAMG** is my first fullstack application, developed to create a platform for movie evaluations. This project includes both backend and frontend components, allowing users to review and rate movies. The application is built with the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**: for building an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: for responsive and stylish design elements.
- **Express**: for managing the backend server and API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: for storing and managing movie data and user evaluations.

This project allowed me to dive into fullstack development, combining a structured backend with a dynamic frontend for a comprehensive movie evaluation experience.
